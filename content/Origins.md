### How it started

Discussions has started at [[13.12.2024]] when [[Eric Conner]] criticized [[Bankless]] guys for being intellectually dishonest and using their platform the shill/advertise the Ethereum competitors under the disguise of **"just asking questions"** without disclosing about the incentives of themselves as well as the guests.

### Manifestation of the MEME

This tweet has gathered a lot of reaction and echoed all over [[CT]] by multiple influential figures and spiked a discussion of concerns everyone had. It struck a chord because during the last couple of years (even in the last bear market), we have seen many people [[FUD]]ing ETH under the disguise of criticism. Even though the criticism was directed towards [[Bankless]], people have resonated because it has been a common practice for the podcasters to create fud and shill other tokens without disclosing conflict of interest.

[[14.12.2024 | A day after]], the **Concernor** meme has been manifested by [[Vance Spencer]]  on the tweet he made criticizing the people who act like they are concerned but instead use their platform to create a [[FUD]]  and shill their bags. He first described this action as $ETH [[Concern Trolling]].

### Proof of memeability

The tweet has summarized the pattern/behaviour so well, it echoed even more around the [[CT]] and resulted in [[Jimmy Ragosa]] creating what we call the OG meme the [[14.12.2024 | same day]]  which confirmed the memeability of this concept and inspired us to move forward and do something with it.
