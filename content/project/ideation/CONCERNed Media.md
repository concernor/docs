Media arm of the [[Concernors]]. The initial idea I have is that it can be a section or type of a panel discussion under [[Leviathan News]] as I think they are one of the people who have the reach and seem to be intellectually honest. But ofc. they have no idea we even exist so lets see... If this ever happens, it has to be community lead.
