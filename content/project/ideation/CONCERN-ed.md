A Directory of educational materials sourced/created by the community.  [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is to be applied meaning when we get concerned that people do not know enough about a certain topic, we try to find a good enough content on the internet and add it to directory. If the content cannot be found, we will put up a bounty for that content to be created.
