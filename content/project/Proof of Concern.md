Proof of concern (**POC**) is the initial NFT offering to secure the funding for the LP once the meme coin launched. 

There will be total of 1559 POC's. In order to mint a POC NFT you need to write your concerns on the blockchain. Those will be the original concerns and the owners of the POC's will be called the [[inner circle]] as they are the very early supporters of this project.

Once the [[CONCERN|$CONCERN]] token is launched. A proportion (tbd.) of the tokens will be put on a vesting contract and airdropped to the hodlers.
