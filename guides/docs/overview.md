All the material related to this project is open sourced under [GitHub - concernor/obsidian-vault](https://github.com/concernor/obsidian-vault) repository. We are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)  because of its flexibility and extensibility. it is recommended to use it as well, however because all the notes are markdown files, you can view/edit them on an editor of your choice. If you want to get more information about the philosophy behind this decision watch this 15 min video titled [The Unreasonable Effectiveness Of Plain Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6M1LyfNY). 

> [!info] tldr; 
> you can clone the repository locally and open the folder in obsidian and start working locally.
